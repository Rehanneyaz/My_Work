    "\n",
    "Escape characters are special characters in strings that are preceded by a backslash (\\). They are used to represent characters that are difficult or impossible to type directly into the source code, such as newline characters, tab characters, or quotation marks.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are some common escape characters and their meanings:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. \\n: Newline character. Inserts a new line.\n",
    "2. \\t: Tab character. Inserts a tab.\n",
    "3. \\': Single quote. Escapes a single quote within a string delimited by single quotes.\n",
    "4. \\\": Double quote. Escapes a double quote within a string delimited by double quotes.\n",
    "5. \\\\: Backslash. Inserts a literal backslash.\n",
