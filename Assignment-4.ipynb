In other words, they contain pointers or memory addresses that point to the location of the list in memory. So, when we assign a list to a variable, the variable holds a reference to that list, not the list itself. This is why we can have multiple variables referencing the same list object, and modifications made through one variable affect the list accessible through the other variables.  "
